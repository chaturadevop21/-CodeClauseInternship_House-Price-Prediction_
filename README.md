# 1. Project Description

  # A. Problem Statement
Thousands of houses are sold everyday. There are some questions every buyer asks himself like: What is the actual price that this house deserves?

# C. Introduction About Project
House Price prediction are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms kitchen parking space and gardens. People don’t know about the factor which influence the house price. But by using the Machine learning we can easily find the house which is to be prefect for us and helps to predict the price accurately.

# 2. Data Collection

For this project we used the data that is available on kaggle.[(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruiqurm/lianjia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruiqurm/lianjia).

There are 26 columns and 318851 Rows. These are the major point about the data set.

url: the url which fetches the data
id: the id of transaction
Lng: and Lat coordinates, using the BD09 protocol.
Cid: community id
tradeTime: the time of transaction
DOM: active days on market
followers: the number of people follow the transaction.
totalPrice: the total price
price: the average price by square
square: the square of house
livingRoom: the number of living room
drawingRoom: the number of drawing room
kitchen: the number of kitchen
bathroom the number of bathroom
floor: the height of the house. I will turn the Chinese characters to English in the next version.
buildingType: including tower( 1 ) , bungalow( 2 )，combination of plate and tower( 3 ), plate( 4 ).
constructionTime: the time of construction
renovationCondition: including other( 1 ), rough( 2 ),Simplicity( 3 ), hardcover( 4 )
buildingStructure: including unknow( 1 ), mixed( 2 ), brick and wood( 3 ), brick and concrete( 4 ),steel( 5 ) and steel-concrete composite ( 6 ).
ladderRatio: the proportion between number of residents on the same floor and number of elevator of ladder. It describes how many ladders a resident have on average.
elevator: have ( 1 ) or not have elevator( 0 )
fiveYearsProperty: if the owner have the property for less than 5 years.
